# About

This is a [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) bucket, _backit_ is a transformation of _bucket_.

## Attention

This is a bucket for *validation* and personal usage only.

In other words,

1. many apps in this bucket will be ported to other buckets, e.g. [main](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main) or [extras](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras), then i will remove them from this bucket.

2. for those apps that does not suitable for other buckets, i will keep them in this bucket.

As a result, autoupdate function won't appear in this bucket for the foreseeable future. I will update the apps of *2* manually.(sadly, a part of the *2*s are the apps that are likely to get no more updates)
