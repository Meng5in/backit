# about

_backit_ is a transformation of _bucket_.

---

this is a scoop bucket for myself, so it may contains
* many bugs
* puzzling commits
* or software that you can't get from internet(maybe)

---

for adding this repo to your scoop, run
```
scoop bucket add backit https://github.com/batkiz/backit
```
in your cli(cmd/powershell).

for removing, just run `scoop rm backit`.
